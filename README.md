# Mini.OutfitExporter

Import and Export Among Us outfits to JSON so you can store your favorite outfits outside of the game.

Status: Maintenance. I'm currently not planning to expand the scope of this mod. If it is necessary to make this mod compatible with new versions of the game, I'll try to update it within a month of release.
